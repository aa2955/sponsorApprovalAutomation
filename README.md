```

---

### Page-by-Page Functionality

#### 1. `Home.jsx`
- Displays a welcome message.
- Uses `localStorage` to greet the current user.
- Place to display important links or Capstone deadlines.

#### 2. `Login.jsx` & `Signup.jsx`
- Sends credentials to backend API.
- Stores user in `localStorage` upon success.
- Role-based form rendering (student vs. sponsor).

#### 3. `Directory.jsx`
- DataGrid-based dashboard.
- Tabs to view:
  - Active Projects
  - All Projects
  - Students
  - Sponsors
  - Approvals
- Eye icon navigates to detail pages.
- Admins can toggle semester and year filters.

#### 4. `Applications.jsx`
- Gateway for role-based application tools.
- Displays:
  - Sponsor Proposal Form
  - Sponsor Approval Form (filtered by organization)

#### 5. `Proposal.jsx`
- Collects full project and sponsor details.
- Sends data to `/createproject` backend route.
- Includes checkbox and file upload logic.

#### 6. `Approval.jsx`
- Allows sponsors/admins to approve student applications.
- Auto-fills fields based on logged-in user.
- Conditionally renders dropdowns based on sponsor org and project.

#### 7. `Project.jsx`
- Detailed view of a single project.
- Includes: description, criteria, skillsets, contact info, and student applicants.
- Buttons:
  - Students can Apply / Commit
  - Admins can Edit / Delete

#### 8. `User.jsx`
- Displays user profile (student/sponsor)
- Includes tables for applied, approved, and committed projects.
- Admins and users themselves can edit or delete profile.

#### 9. `EditUser.jsx` & `EditProject.jsx`
- Dynamic forms that load current data.
- Role-based access control logic in place.
- Save changes via PATCH request.

#### 10. `Navbar.jsx`
- Top bar used across all pages.
- Updates active tab via `currentPage` prop.
- Logout functionality clears `localStorage` and redirects.

---

### Styling (CSS Folder)
- `styles/Directory.css`: Used for directory layout and table overrides.
- `styles/Form.css`: Shared by all forms (Signup, Proposal, Approval).
- `styles/Navbar.css`, `Login.css`, `Signup.css`, etc. for page-specific designs.

---

### Known Issues & Limitations

- **No Role Protection on Signup**: Users can choose whatever role they want to and also pick admin status for themselves.
- **Not Mobile Optimized**: DataGrid and form layouts break on small screens.
- **No JWT Authentication**: Current auth system stores user data in `localStorage` only, not secure.

---

### Design Decisions

- **Single Site > Discord/Formsite**: Moving all workflows to one site ensures:
  - Real-time approval updates
  - Cleaner audit trail (e.g., `approvals` table)
  - Easier onboarding for sponsors
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Logic in each page ensures only the appropriate user can view/edit content.
- **Separation of Concerns**: React handles rendering + routing; Flask handles logic + data.
- **One Project Commitment**: Prevents accidental overcommitment from students.
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Adds polish to transitions (e.g., welcome message).

---

### Unfulfilled Requirements

| Feature | Reason Not Completed |
|--------|----------------------|
| Track Selection Forms | Needed new route/model + UI |
| Judge Dashboard | Out of scope for MVP |
| Sponsor Account Verification | No email service or code verification yet |
| Student Resume Uploads | File upload logic not complete |
| Admin Bulk Imports | Would require CSV parsing + database merge logic |

---

### Future Stretch Goals

- **Full Admin Dashboard**: Drag-and-drop assignments, export tools, search filters.
- **JWT Auth + Refresh Tokens**: Replace `localStorage` with secure cookie-based auth.
- **Judging Rubric Module**: Admins create rubrics, judges score directly on the platform.
- **Sponsor Analytics Dashboard**: Track engagement across semesters.
- **Automated Resume Parsing**: Integrate tools to parse resumes
- **Document Upload + Preview**: Allow uploaded PDFs to preview within the browser.
